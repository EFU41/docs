It's the easiest part to deploy your function or application to Each servers. You can use Magicpoint CLI tool to deploy your application!

If you have not configured your framework you can visit [Magicpoint Configuration](/magicpoint/configuration) page.

You can follow these steps to deploy your application:
- Prepare magicpoint.yaml
- Execute command

## Set your environment
```yaml magicpoint.yaml
application: 
    name: Magicpoint Test Application
    env:
        - EXAMPLE_ENV_VARIABLE: YOUR_VALUE
build:
  gpu: A100
  gpu_memory: 40Gi
  cpu: 1
  scaling:
    type: QueueDepth 
    max_task_per_replica: 3
    min_replicas: 
    max_replicas: 2
  python_version: 3.8
  python_packages:
    - pillow==8.2.0
  cuda: "11.1" 
```

## Execute just one command
```sh
magicpoint deploy app.py
```

```sh
[âœ…] Validating magicpoint.yaml
[âœ…] Validation app.py for Magicpoint Test Application
[âœ…] Deploying Magicpoint Test Application
[âœ…] Deployed on: https://magicpoint-test-application-x2h2gvhax.eachlabs.a
```

ðŸŽ‰ You are all set! You can track your apps on console!
